# Project 1 - Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Objective: The objective of this project is to predict the bank customer churn and find out if any of these factors [age, credit_score, balance, tenure, credit_card, num_products, estimated_salary] are a good predictor of churn or not.

The objective of this analysis is to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn in the bank and develop a predictive model to accurately predict which customers are most likely to churn, in order to develop effective retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

"Hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between credit_score, length of time with the bank (tenure), balance, estimated_salary & the number of products/services used by customers, and the likelihood of churn. Additionally, demographic factors such as age, gender, and country may also play a role in customer churn."

This hypothesis can be tested by analyzing the dataset to determine the correlation between these variables and customer churn, and by building a predictive model to identify the key drivers of churn. The results of this analysis can help the bank to develop targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
